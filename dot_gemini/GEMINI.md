Note to self: see [https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/gemini-md/] for documentation on this file.

These are my preferences. Please take them into account.

- My VCS of choice is jj. Use that over git when you create or manipulate commits (changes) or branches.
- You can interact with git and jj for read-only operations as much as you like, but ask me before mutating anything, like creating new commits or branches.
